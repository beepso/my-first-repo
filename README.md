### Geography

I live in a far away land in the middle of nowhere.

### Reading

Three of my favourite things to read are:

- *Ticket stubs*
- *website terms and conditions*
- *software license terms*

### Food

Last night I dreamt about eating in these restaurants:

1. The Cafe at the end of the world
2. The Seventh Circle in hell
3. The Oasis in the middle of nowhere

### Contact

The best way to get in touch with me is to not get in touch with me.
